# AI Test Case Generator

## Overview

The AI Test Case Generator is an innovative application that uses artificial intelligence to streamline and optimize software testing processes.

## Key Features

- **Intelligent Test Case Generation**: Leverage advanced AI algorithms for automated test case creation.
- **Time Efficiency**: Accelerate the testing lifecycle and save valuable time.
- **Thorough Test Coverage**: Ensure comprehensive coverage of your software applications.
- **Increased Accuracy**: Minimize human errors in test case creation.


## How It Works

1. Input your software requirements, user stories, or system specifications.
2. The AI analyzes the input data, identifying potential test scenarios, edge cases, and critical paths.
3. Watch as the AI generates a detailed set of test cases.
